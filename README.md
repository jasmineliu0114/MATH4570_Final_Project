This study leverages advanced machine learning techniques to optimize the classification of CT images depicting various types of intracranial hemorrhages. Utilizing a rich dataset provided by Zeta Surgical, Inc., we built several machine learning and data classification models in order to find which model achieves superior classification results. Our findings indicate that transfer learning, in conjunction with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), outperforms other tested models in accuracy and efficiency. Future research will expand on these models, explore alternative machine learning models, and finally implement segmentation processes to enhance diagnostic capabilities. This ongoing research aims to develop a robust tool for aiding in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhages in clinical settings.
